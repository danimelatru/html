# My HTML Course Notes

This is a simple repo to hold the files and notes I made during a basic HTML course. It's mainly a personal reference guide for myself.

## What's Inside

* **`index.html`**: The standard, barebones HTML template. It's the starting point for any new page.

* **`instrucciones.html`**: This is the main cheat sheet. It's a messy but useful collection of all the important tags and concepts we covered. The filename is in Spanish and means "instructions".

    It includes quick examples for things like:
    * Basic text formatting (headers, paragraphs, bold, italics)
    * Links (internal and external)
    * Lists (ordered and unordered)
    * Adding images, video, and audio
    * Creating tables
    * Building forms with different input types
    * Page structure (`<div>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)

## How to Use

Feel free to clone or download this. The `instrucciones.html` file is best viewed in a code editor to see the tags clearly.
